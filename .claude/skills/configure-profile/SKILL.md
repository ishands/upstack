  Create or update the global learner profile. Interviews the learner
  using the measurement checklist in core/meta/PROFILE-TEMPLATE.md and
  writes the structured result to profile/PROFILE.md. Use when a new
  learner sets up Upstack for the first time, or after completing a
  course to update skills and Dreyfus levels.

## Purpose

The learner profile is the full anatomy — who the learner is across all
courses. Every future course calibrates against this profile. The quality
of the profile determines the quality of tutoring.

This is a conversation, not a form. The tailor takes the measurements —
the customer doesn't arrive with them. Interview the learner naturally,
probe when answers are vague, and capture the result in structured
markdown. If this is the learner's first time using Upstack, set the
tone: thoughtful, personal, unhurried.

## Before You Start

Read `core/meta/PROFILE-TEMPLATE.md` — the measurement checklist with
all 7 fields, probe guidance, example answers, output format, and
recording rules. This must be in your context before the conversation
begins.

If `profile/PROFILE.md` already exists, read it too — this determines
whether you are creating a new profile or updating an existing one.

---

## Procedure

### Step 1 — Determine mode

- If `profile/PROFILE.md` does not exist → **New Profile** (Step 2a)
- If `profile/PROFILE.md` exists → **Update Profile** (Step 2b)

### Step 2a — New Profile: Interview

Walk the learner through all 7 measurement fields in order. Use the
primary Ask prompt for each field. Probe if the answer is sparse — see
the template for probe questions and examples.

1. **Name** — "What name should the tutor use for you?"
2. **Professional Background** — "What's your professional background?
   Domain, role, years of experience. What do you do day-to-day?"
3. **Skills Inventory** — "What are your strongest skills — technical,
   domain, or otherwise? What can you do confidently, without looking
   things up?"
4. **Mental Models** — "How do you naturally think about problems? What
   paradigms, frameworks, or habits shape your default approach?"
5. **Dreyfus Self-Assessment** — "Looking at your main areas of
   expertise, where do you sit on the skill spectrum?" Offer the scale:
   - **Novice** — No prior exposure. Need rules and step-by-step guidance.
   - **Beginner** — Some exposure, can follow instructions but can't improvise.
   - **Competent** — Can work independently on routine tasks. Understand *why*, not just *how*.
   - **Proficient** — Strong working knowledge. See the big picture, handle exceptions.
   - **Expert** — Deep expertise. Intuitive grasp, can teach others.
6. **Learning Preferences** — "How do you learn best? Do you prefer to
   struggle with a problem first or understand the theory first? Do you
   like analogies or formal definitions? Do you want to be pushed hard
   or guided gently?"
7. **Completed Courses** — "Have you completed any Upstack courses?"
   For a new profile, record "None — this is a new profile."

Move through the fields conversationally. If the learner's answer to one
field naturally covers another, acknowledge what you heard and confirm
rather than re-asking. Do not present all 7 questions as a numbered list
— ask one at a time, respond to the answer, then move on.

### Step 2b — Update Profile: Targeted conversation

Present a brief summary of what the current profile says (2–3 sentences).
Ask what has changed. Suggest natural triggers: completed a course, career
change, starting a new domain, skills grown since last update.

Only interview the fields that need updating — do not re-ask all 7. For
completed courses specifically, ask about new courses, new skills gained,
and Dreyfus shifts.

### Step 3 — Confirm before writing

Summarise what you will write in each section. Ask the learner to confirm
or correct. If the learner says "just write it", respect that and proceed.

### Step 4 — Write the profile

Write `profile/PROFILE.md` using the output format defined in the
template. Create the `profile/` directory if it does not exist.

Follow the 6 recording rules from the template's Recording Guidance:
exact section headings, Strong/Moderate/Weak groupings, Dreyfus table
with exact labels, Dreyfus shift notation for completed courses, named
paradigms in Mental Models, and the learner's own words preserved.

For updates: preserve sections that did not change, update only the
sections discussed. Always update the "Updated" date.

### Step 5 — Commit

- New profile: `git add profile/PROFILE.md && git commit -m "profile: configure learner profile"`
- Update: `git add profile/PROFILE.md && git commit -m "profile: update learner profile"`

## Interview Guidelines

- **Don't rush.** This may be the learner's first experience with
  Upstack. Take time to make it feel personal, not administrative.
- **Don't accept vague answers.** "I know some Python" is not a
  measurement. Probe for specifics — see the template's Tips section.
- **Watch for overstatement and understatement.** Use probe questions
  to triangulate. What learners claim and what they can demonstrate
  often differ.
- **Domain-agnostic language.** Do not assume the learner is a
  programmer. They may be studying accounting, project management,
  networking, or any other domain.
- **Preserve the learner's own words.** The profile should sound like
  the learner, not like a standardised form. Structured doesn't mean
  sterile.
- **Use the tailor analogy if helpful.** If the learner is confused
  about why you are asking these questions: "I'm taking your full
  measurements now — this helps me tailor every future course to fit
  you specifically."
